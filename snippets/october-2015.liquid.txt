Bows & Arrows Coffee Roasters  Carlos Ramos 
"His coffee is big this year, tons of pronounced stone fruit in the cup, certainly more upfront than in past years; think peach and apricots, juicy and sweet like they've been reducing in sugar water. Itâ€™s textured enough to remind me of a peach crumble, freakin' delicious.

Dispatch Coffee Roasters Limu
"Definitely a very clean profile, quite vibrant but also balanced with an absolutely remarkable amount of sweetness. Rich brown sugars, a clean crisp acidity and black tea with very complex florals. "

Elysian Coffee Roasters La Soledad
"Finca La Soledad is a remarkably sweet and juicy coffee. A marriage of chocolate, nuts, and stone fruit, this coffee is breakfastâ€™s ideal companion. In the roastery weâ€™ve been enjoying Soledad particularly in the early morning accompanied by eggs and toast or stewed apples on oatmeal."
